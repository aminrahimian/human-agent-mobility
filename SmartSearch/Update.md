## Reconstruct the 2-dimensional flow field based on the information of scattering particles provided by the dataset to make it convinient for interpolation
## Introduce timer to measure the running time of each episode
## Replace the reflective boundary conditions with periodic boundary condition (do not need to change the direction of velocity)
## Agents move with constant speed (no acceleration)
