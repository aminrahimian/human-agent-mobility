Programs
>> Targets.m --> Assuming that targets distributes as a pattern of hierarchical Gaussian distribution, this program create a target distribution and plot it.
>> SearchKnownTargets.m --> Model of Optimized varied mu search with known target distribution
>> CombinedLevySearch.m --> Model of varied mu search with memorizing parameter tm
>> CombinedLevySearch_Dist.m --> Model of varied mu search based on distance Rm with moving targets
>> CombinedLevySearch_DistPar.m --> Model of varied mu search based on distance
>> ParSetAnalysis.m --> analyze ParSet.mat

Functions
>> RandTruncLevyMulti --> sampling values from Levy distribution
>> pdf_plotter_new --> plotting normalized PDF
